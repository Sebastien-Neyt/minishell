$IFS not implemented

TODO LIST:
	- cd ~$something
	- `echo hello |` and then an `ls` on the next line gives a error message & leaks!!
	- `echo hello > test1 4` -> creates the file test1 with the line "hello 4" in it
	- `cd $HOME/Documents?`
	- `echo hello >>> test` should not do anything -> check the order of the tokens.
	- `echo hello > > test` should not do anything -> check the order of the tokens. 
	- ctrl-c should give 1 exit code? not 130
	- `exit -10` sets exit code to 1 and bash to 246
	- `export` & `env` have different outputs?

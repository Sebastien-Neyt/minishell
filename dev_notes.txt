env should be protected

bash: export: `TEST test=dfv v fd vdf v df v': not a valid identifier

bash: $test: ambiguous redirect

SHELVL		should be initialize to 1 by default if not already defined
_		should be initialize by default
PWD 		should be initialize to the currrent directory by default


additonal work to do on the tokenizing dependig on if the word is a path or not
	might be doable in the exec part of the code

~ will be expanded to the value of $HOME

$? should expend to the exit code

the . [filename] [options] call the source builtin which is not required

Word spliting should be implemented after expensions
$IFS not implemented

All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments.

do not forget to treat >| as a redirect and not as to different META

TODO LIST:
	- error messages and other macros
	- redirection
	- heredocs

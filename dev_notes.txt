env should be protected

bash: export: `TEST test=dfv v fd vdf v df v': not a valid identifier

bash: $test: ambiguous redirect
preset the token of each word when doing the word spliiting

what do siganals do exactly
	should I do something something in particular in the forks ?
	do i need to transmit signals from minishell to the forks ?
	what happens if sigkill a command inside a pipeline ?
	which command of the pipeline is at the forefront ?

SHELVL		should be initialize to 1 by default if not already defined
_		should be initialize by default
PWD 		should be initialize to the currrent directory by default


additonal work to do on the tokenizing dependig on if the word is a path or not
	might be doable in the exec part of the code

~ will be expanded to the value of $HOME

the . [filename] [options] call the source builtin which is not required

Word spliting should be implemented after expensions
$IFS not implemented

all builtins All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments.

do not forget to treat >| as a redirect and not as to different META

TODO LIST:
	- error messages and other macros
	- ft_exit and cleaning fonctions;
	- maybe remake the append line with rl_on_newline
	- the fucking pipes !!! rewatch the coce vault video or something
